========================
NumPy C Skeleton Package
========================

This is a skeleton package that can be used to easily create a Python package 
that links to a C/C++ library. It is especially useful when you want to create 
a NumPy extension for a Python package.

Why?
====

It turned out to be quite difficult to get the ``setup.py`` file right when I 
tried to do this myself, so I thought I'd save you the trouble and create a 
skeleton package. You can read more about my motivations for making this `in 
this blog post <https://gertjanvandenburg.com/blog/numpy_c_extension/>`_.
